# CS230
The client for this project was The Gaming Room. They wanted an application to run their game Draw it or Lose it over multiple different platforms
I think that one thing I did well in developing this documentation is identifying design constraints and creating a UML diagram for the project. 
I found that the UML diagram was helpful for designing the code in this project as it provided a layout to follow for the project. 
If I had to redo one part of this document it would be the evaluation section. I would improve this section by going into more information on the server side evaluations for each platform. 
It is important to include the User's needs while designing as if the project does not meet the end users needs the project has no purpose and will result in wasted time and money.
In designing the software I used the UML diagram to get the layout of the application which helped to create a bulk of the code. In the future I think a software design document could be very helpful for designing similar applications.
